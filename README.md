ESP32-CAM-Based-Indian-Currency-Recognition-System-using-Edge-Impulse.



🔍 Project Overview

The ESP32-CAM captures images of Indian currency notes placed in front of the camera. These images are processed locally using a machine learning model trained on Edge Impulse. Once a currency denomination is recognized, the corresponding LED glows to indicate the detected note, and the result is printed on the Serial Monitor.

This project highlights the concept of AI on Edge, where machine learning inference runs directly on embedded hardware, enabling low latency, better privacy, and offline operation.

🧠 What is AI on Edge?

AI on Edge, also known as edge computing, refers to running artificial intelligence algorithms directly on embedded devices such as microcontrollers and microprocessors instead of sending data to cloud servers. This approach offers several advantages:
•	Low latency
•	Reduced bandwidth usage
•	Improved data privacy
•	Real-time decision making
Object recognition is one of the most important applications of AI on Edge, allowing devices to visually identify and classify objects such as currency notes.
